# Hidden Gems Detection Algorithm Documentation

## Overview

The Hidden Gems detection system identifies high-quality Hacker News posts from low-karma authors that would otherwise be overlooked. This algorithm serves as the first stage of content curation, feeding the "Live Hidden Gems Feed" and providing candidates for the more advanced Super Gems analysis.

## Core Philosophy

The system operates on the principle that **good content can come from anyone**, regardless of their karma score. It aims to surface valuable technical posts, Show HN projects, and innovative solutions from newcomers and lesser-known contributors to the HN community.

## Algorithm Architecture

### Stage 1: Data Collection
- **Source**: Hacker News Firebase API (`/newstories.json` and `/item/{id}.json`)
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes (configurable via `POST_COLLECTION_INTERVAL_MINUTES`)
- **Volume**: Up to 500 stories per collection cycle
- **Real-time**: No rate limits on HN API allow for frequent polling

### Stage 2: Author Filtering
**Primary Filter**: `author_karma < KARMA_THRESHOLD`
- **Default Threshold**: 100 karma points
- **Rationale**: Users with low karma are less likely to reach the front page organically
- **Configurable**: Set via `KARMA_THRESHOLD` environment variable

### Stage 3: Quality Analysis
Each post undergoes comprehensive quality analysis using the `QualityAnalyzer` class:

## Quality Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Technical Depth (Weight: 25%)
**Purpose**: Identify posts with substantial technical content

**Scoring Method**:
- **Basic Technical Keywords** (60% cap): API, framework, database, Docker, AI, etc.
  - Score = min(keyword_count / 5, 0.6)
- **Advanced Technical Keywords** (1.5x multiplier): Distributed systems, concurrency, cryptography, etc.
  - Score = min(keyword_count / 3, 0.4) Ã— 1.5
- **Domain Bonus** (+0.2): GitHub, arXiv, Papers with Code

**Example Keywords**:
```
Basic: algorithm, open source, python, react, postgresql
Advanced: distributed systems, consensus, neural networks, jit compilation
```

### 2. Originality (Weight: 25%)
**Purpose**: Favor original creations over simple link sharing

**Scoring Factors**:
- **Show HN Posts**: +0.4 (explicit original content)
- **Creation Indicators**: +0.3 ("built", "created", "made", "developed")
- **GitHub Repository**: +0.2 (source code available)
- **Personal Indicators**: +0.2 ("my project", "I built")
- **Demo/Live Site**: +0.1 ("demo", "try it", "playground")

### 3. Problem Solving (Weight: 20%)
**Purpose**: Identify posts that address real developer needs

**Keywords Categories**:
- **Solution Words**: "solves", "fixes", "helps", "alternative", "automates"
- **Pain Point Words**: "frustrating", "difficult", "inefficient", "manual"

**Scoring**: 
- Solution indicators: min(count / 3, 0.7)
- Pain points: min(count / 2, 0.3)

### 4. GitHub Repository Quality (Weight: 15%)
**Purpose**: Assess the quality of associated repositories

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Stars**: Logarithmic scale (up to 0.3 points)
- **Recent Activity**: 0.2 points if updated within 30 days
- **Description**: 0.1 points for repository description
- **Language Diversity**: 0.1 points for multiple languages
- **License**: 0.1 points for open source license
- **Active Issues**: 0.1 points for community engagement

### 5. Domain Reputation (Weight: 10%)
**Purpose**: Consider the credibility of the linked domain

**Domain Categories**:
- **High Reputation** (0.8): GitHub, arXiv, IEEE, ACM, major tech companies
- **Medium Reputation** (0.6): Substack, GitLab, Hashnode
- **Unknown Domains** (0.4): Default score
- **Text Posts** (0.5): No URL provided

### 6. Spam Detection (Negative Weight: -50%)
**Purpose**: Filter out low-quality and promotional content

**Spam Indicators**:
- **Short titles** (<20 chars): +0.2 spam score
- **Excessive exclamation marks** (>1): +0.3 spam score
- **ALL CAPS abuse** (>2 instances): +0.4 spam score
- **Spam keywords**: Cryptocurrency, trading, "get rich", "click here"
- **Suspicious symbols**: "$$$", "ðŸ’°"
- **Short content**: No URL and <50 chars text
- **Suspicious domains**: Bit.ly, affiliate links

## Overall Score Calculation

### Formula
```python
overall_score = (
    technical_depth * 0.25 +
    originality * 0.25 +
    problem_solving * 0.20 +
    github_quality * 0.15 +
    domain_reputation * 0.10 -
    spam_likelihood * 0.5
)
```

### Score Clamping
- **Range**: [0.0, 1.0]
- **Method**: `max(0.0, min(overall_score, 1.0))`

## Hidden Gem Classification

### Qualification Criteria
A post becomes a "Hidden Gem" when ALL conditions are met:

1. **Author Karma**: `< KARMA_THRESHOLD` (default: 100)
2. **Quality Score**: `>= MIN_INTEREST_SCORE` (default: 0.3)
3. **Spam Filter**: `spam_likelihood < 0.4`

### Classification Logic
```python
is_hidden_gem = (
    author_karma < KARMA_THRESHOLD and
    overall_interest >= MIN_INTEREST_SCORE and
    spam_likelihood < 0.4
)
```

## Live Feed Display

### Sorting and Filtering
- **Primary Sort**: Quality score (descending)
- **Secondary Sort**: Creation time (newest first)
- **Filters**: Non-spam gems only
- **Real-time**: Updates every collection cycle (5 minutes)

### Feed Characteristics
- **Responsive**: Immediate updates when new gems are found
- **Quality Focused**: Only displays gems above threshold
- **Spam-Free**: Automatic spam filtering
- **Fresh Content**: Emphasizes recent discoveries

## Configuration Parameters

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Core Thresholds
KARMA_THRESHOLD=100                   # Max author karma for gems
